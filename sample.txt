I was a samurai longing for the day when I could finally be reunited with my beloved. I had been away for far too long, fighting in battles and wars that seemed to have no end. But now, the time had come for me to return home and be with her once more. During my journey I had slept with the whores of many lands, but none could compare to the beauty and grace of my beloved. I could hardly contain my excitement as I rode through the familiar countryside, the scent of cherry blossoms filling the air. I knew that she would be waiting for me, her eyes filled with tears of joy and longing. And as I finally reached the gates of my home, I saw her standing there, her face radiant with happiness. I dismounted from my horse and ran to her, sweeping her up in my arms and holding her close. And in that moment, I knew that I was home at last, in the arms of the woman I truly desired.
